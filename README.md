This is a Jewellery Shop Management System Application made in Turbo C++ using C++ programming language. It is a very useful application for all the jewellers as it can be used for maintaining customer records, item stock, making sales, generating bills by making the calculations automatically, updating the transactions on item stock, maintaining a balance account for each customer and displaying all the previous sales for each customer. It is a completely functional, usable and user friendly application as it uses File Handling to save all the records and is fast and easy to use. One of the best features of this application is that it keeps the data secure with password protection. Also, on a single computer a person can make multiple accounts for his multiple jewellery stores. The source code of this application is made in such a way that it is easy to read as it uses the concept of modularity (Encapsulation). Also, it has some unused features in the code which can be easily worked upon to inculcate the feature of calculating Profit and Loss made by the jeweller.
